## Features

1. The task is to write a simple time tracker with the ability to start / stop.
2. Tasks require a name.
3. By default, the application should show a list of tracked tasks along with the amount of time spent on them.
4. (optional) After pressing the tracked entry, a modal should appear with a primitive view of details (name, tracked time, start time, end time).
5. (optional) The tracker should allow you to resume work on a post from the past. It may just be a new post with the same title.
6. Only one entry can be active at a time.
7. The tracker should allow you to count time in the background and when the application is stopped/killed.
8. If the application is turned off during time counting, after restarting the time should continue to be counted.
